# Codecide
  GPT Interview Assistant

## Project Overview

Welcome to the GPT Interview Assistant, a project aimed at revolutionizing coding interviews by developing a free and open-source GPT model tailored for online interview scenarios. As a graduate student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, my goal is to empower developers to confidently navigate online interviews, enhancing problem-solving skills in real-time.

## Project Highlights

### Inspiration

The driving force behind this initiative is to address the unique challenges posed by online interviews. While tools like ChatGPT are valuable for learning, a dedicated solution is essential to align with the dynamics of online interview settings, emphasizing adaptability and quick problem-solving skills.

### Blueprint

As a master's student in AI and ML, I've taken on the challenge of developing a GPT model explicitly designed for the online interview landscape. What sets this project apart is its commitment to being free and open source, aiming to make a meaningful contribution to the tech community and level the playing field for interviewees worldwide.

## Features

Imagine a tool that listens to interview questions, comprehends them, and provides on-screen answers in real-time. Here's a glimpse of what's in store:

1. **Voice-Activated Responses:** Crafted to interpret interviewers' questions and formulate articulate responses, ensuring a seamless interview experience.

2. **Real-Time Interaction:** Offers instant, constructive feedback and guidance during interviews, enhancing candidates' problem-solving skills on the fly.

3. **Interview Simulation:** Replicates the unpredictable nature of actual interviews through dynamic scenarios, preparing candidates for any curveball questions that may come their way.

## How to Contribute

This project thrives on community involvement. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting your coding journey, your insights are invaluable. Join us for collaborative coding sessions, contribute ideas, and help refine the model. Your input plays a crucial role in shaping this innovative tool.
